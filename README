Dolphin Image Processor
=================================

Play Application.

CONTROLLER:
Application.java:
-Opens browser for image upload
-Uploads image chosen by user.
-Currently drives operations of the application. Creates objects that perform the image analysis steps on the image.

SERVICES:
Threshold.java:
-Contains minimum Color and maximum Color, to define the threshold range

DolphinAnalyzer.java:
-Creates binary mask image from the original, based on the threshold.
-Contains sample algorithms to edit images on the pixel level.
-Includes functions for Executive Control, which scores different parts of the image and selects the best one to suggest to the user.

GenericDialog_Test.java
-Shows a dialog box that makes Executive Control suggestions to the user. Currently not used by the current version.

Pixel.java
-Contains x, y location of a pixel, and its RGB color values.
-Given a threshold, the Pixel can determine if it is within the threshold.

ImageSegmenter.java
-Uses a 2D array of labels and a binary mask image to label each contiguous segment in the image.
-To do this, calls a depth-first search on every pixel within the threshold.
-After calculating the segments, creates the SegmentTable.

SegmentTable.java
-Data structure that is a list of lists of pixels.
-Each sublist contains all the pixels in a given segment.
-The integer index of each list refers to each segment in the image.
